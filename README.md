# ARFoundationUnityChan
This is a Unity app that uses ARFoundation.  
https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@4.1/manual/index.html

When you start the app, the camera detects a flat surface, and when you tap the screen, you can place Unity-chan in that location.  
It is designed for iOS and Android applications.
